# FLAb: Fitness Landscapes for Antibodies
Official repository for `FLAb: Benchmarking deep learning methods for antibody fitness prediction`. FLAb provides experimental data for six properties of therapeutic antibodies: Expression, themrostability, immunogenicity, aggregation, polyreactivity, and binding affinity. We use FLAb to assess the performance of several widely used deep learning models and compare them to physics-based Rosetta. A convenience interface to the FLAb Github repository can be found [here](https://r2.graylab.jhu.edu/flab?current_page=1&key_words_value=&category=aggregation&assay=any&study=any&year=any&license=any&size=any&).

## Install

For easiest use, [create a conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) for each scoring and structure prediction method:

```bash
$ conda env create --name ENV_NAME --file envs/[ENV]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where `[ENV]` ∈ `antiberty.yml`, `esmif.yml`, `iglm.yml`, `mpnn.yml`, `progen.yml`, `pyrosetta.yml`

## Command line usage

FLAb supports structure prediction with IgFold and perplexity scoring with AntiBERTy, ProGen2, IgLM, ESM-2, ESM-IF, proteinMPNN, and Rosetta energy.

### Antibody structure prediction from sequence in csv format

Antibody sequences must be provided as a csv of sequences, where the columns are chains `heavy` and `light` and column values are the sequences. This step is necessary to complete first before scoring with structure-based methods (i.e. ESM-IF, proteinMPNN, Rosetta energy).

```bash
$ sbatch sbatch/structure.sh data/tm/Hie2022_C143_Tm.csv 
```

### Expected output

After the script completes, antibody structures will be saved in a new directory path `structures/tm/Hie2022_C143_Tm/`

## Perplexity scoring and correlation to fitness

Calculate perplexity for a csv of sequences with the columns `heavy` for heavy chain sequences, `light` for light chain sequences, and `fitness` for some experimental antibody fitness metric.

```bash
$ sbatch sbatch/score_seq.sh data/tm/Hie2022_C143_Tm.csv [MODEL] [SIZE]
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where `[MODEL]` ∈ `antiberty`, `esmif`, `iglm`, `mpnn`, `progen`, `pyrosetta`

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If using `progen`: `[SIZE]` ∈ `small`, `medium`, `base`, `oas`, `large`, `BFD90`, `xlarge`. Otherwise leave `[SIZE]` blank.

For structure-based scoring methods, structures must first be predicted.

```bash
$ sbatch sbatch/score_struc.sh data/tm/Hie2022_C143_Tm.csv esmif
```

### Expected output

After the script completes, the CSV with heavy and light sequences will be updated with a new column for uncertainty. The CSV will be saved in a new directory path within `scores/tm/Hie2022_C143_Tm/`

## Contributions & Bug reports

FLAb is a living benchmark: We are motivated to continually expand the antibody fitness data utilized and methods evaluated. We invite contributions and encourage contributors to add data or test new models (e.g. ESM-2, CDConv, ProNet, MaSIF, MIF, CARP, ProtBERT, UniRep, ProteinBERT). To make contributions, either submit a [pull request](https://github.com/Graylab/FLAb/pulls) or email `mchungy1@jhu.edu` for help on how to integrate your data into FLAb.

If you run into any problems while using FLAb, please create a [Github issue](https://github.com/Graylab/FLAb/issues) with a description of the problem and the steps to reproduce it.
